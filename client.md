   1. Here are nine crucial questions to ask your clients at the start of any web design project:
1. ##### Do you currently have a website? If so, what is/isn’t working for you?
   2. Unless you’re starting from scratch, your client’s current website is a mine of information. Find out what CMS they use, how long they’ve had it, and how easy it is to update. What do they like and what can’t they wait to see the back of? Can they provide you with a Google Analytics report?
1. ##### What are your goals for this project?
   1. Ask for your client’s definition of success. Do they want to increase the amount of visitors, up the average order size, or boost the users on their web forum? Perhaps they want to encourage greater engagement via their blog, increase their brand visibility, or encourage people to sign up for their email newsletter/free trial/white paper, etc.
1. ##### Who is your target audience?
   1. Design is subjective and beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder. You’re not designing this website purely for your client. It has to resonate strongly with their users and target audience, otherwise, they simply won’t use it – online audiences are incredibly fickle today, owing to the hugely competitive market.
1. ##### What specific features do you want on the site?
   1. Establish at the outset whether your client has any particular functionalities they want included on their new website. Some things may be obvious. If your client runs a restaurant for example, they’ll need their opening hours and menu included, whereas if they run a hotel, they may want an online booking form.
1. ##### How can we avoid failure?
   1. Ask them to show you their least favorite websites and point out the design elements, features, and styles that make them shudder. This way, you can strike out potential failures before you get into the nitty-gritty of the project.
1. ##### Who are your main competitors?


    1.Discovering your client’s main competitors provides you with another useful source of information. Once they’ve indicated their main rivals, you can gather information that will help guide your web design. Look at the elements that work well on their sites, and see if there are things that fall flat. Your intention here isn’t to copy what’s been done before, but to learn from their successes and failures. Asking your client to point out the things they do and don’t like on their competitors’ websites is another useful indicator of your client’s likes and dislikes.

1. ##### What makes you different from your competitors?
    1. Knowing your client’s unique selling point will help you design a site that stands apart from their competitors’. In the busy, noisy, competitive online world, businesses need to be truly remarkable to be successful. So how can you grab people’s attention when they land on the site? How can you make that tricky first impression count?

This doesn’t have to be anything major; it can be as simple as a free consultation or awesome customer service. Other things that make businesses stand out include speedy or free delivery on products, stocking the cheapest or best quality products in their area, having an amazing guarantee or returns procedure, or offering unique packages. By learning how your client differs from their competitors, you can deliver a site that does the same.
1. ##### What’s the scope of the project?

    1. Finally, clarify the scope of the project. You need a clear understanding of your client’s final deadline as well as any key milestones they want to meet along the way – this is crucial to keeping the project on track and ensuring you live up to expectations. You also need to know the budget and, more importantly, establish whether there’s any flexibility in the timeline and budget.
